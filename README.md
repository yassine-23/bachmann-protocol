**NOTICE OF PRIOR ART ESTABLISHMENT**

This repository establishes a public, timestamped record of the invention known as:

- **The Bachmann Protocol** — A treatment framework for ischemic limb syndrome
- **The PuzzleFlow System** — A thermo-hydraulic soft-robotic medical device

**Inventor:** Yassine Drani  
**Origin:** El Jadida, Morocco / Zurich, Switzerland  
**Date of Conception:** January 2025 - February 2026  
**Date of Documentation:** February 5, 2026  
**Date of Public Disclosure:** February 8, 2026

## What Is This?

The Bachmann Protocol is a **paradigm shift** in the treatment of pressure-induced ischemic necrosis in immobile patients.

### The Problem

Current "gold standard" interventions (foam offloading, alternating-pressure mattresses) address only **mechanical pressure** while:
- ❌ **Exacerbating** thermal accumulation ("Incubator Effect")
- ❌ **Ignoring** venous stasis from absent muscle pump
- ❌ **Causing** shear trauma during repositioning

### The Solution: Active Exo-Organ

The PuzzleFlow System addresses the complete **"Triad of Failure"**:

| Failure Mode | Solution | Mechanism |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Thermal dysregulation | Isothermic Regulation | Convective heat exchange at 32-34°C |
| Venous stasis | "Phantom Muscle" | McKibben pneumatic actuators |
| Mechanical pressure | Isobaric Matrix | Pascal's Law fluid distribution |
| Bacterial colonization | Monolithic Skin | DLP-printed seamless construction |

## The Story Behind This

This protocol was not conceived in a laboratory. It was born from **365 days of continuous bedside observation** of my partner, Walter Bernhard Bachmann.

Walter was an 82-year-old Swiss citizen who suffered a spinal fracture in January 2025. Despite the deployment of every available anti-pressure device, his condition deteriorated to gangrene. Every failure I witnessed became a lesson. Every wound became a teacher.

Walter passed away on **February 5, 2026**, at University Hospital Zürich.

This invention is his legacy. Every device that carries this name, every patient spared his suffering, is **Walter's gift to humanity**.
